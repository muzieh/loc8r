use thepolyglotdeveloper
We’re using the database thepolyglotdeveloper, but it doesn’t exist until we start creating collections and data. To create a collection with data, we can do something like this:

db.people.save({ firstname: "Nic", lastname: "Raboy" })
db.people.save({ firstname: "Maria", lastname: "Raboy" })
With two documents created in a new people collection in our thepolyglotdeveloper database, we can query for data using something like the following:

db.people.find({ firstname: "Nic" })
